The RPi B, B+, and 2 map the GPIO 14/15 pins to UART0. These are the pins we use
for serial connection to the Pixhawk. The RPi3 mapped those pins to UART1 since
UART0 is now used for Bluetooth. 

To fix this, we must disable bluetooth. 

In /boot/config.txt

Add
dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt

then run
sudo systemctl disable hciuart
